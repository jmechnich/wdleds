The development of wdleds is progressing. If anyone would like to provide some information as to the product
and vendor ids of the following products (just run "lsusb -v" and post an issue and the project site).

- My Book Premium ES
- My Book Premium
- My Book Pro II

To my knowledge, all these products use the exact same executable for the LEDs, on the windows side of things.
In addition, I believe that these products use similar Oxford Semiconductor chips (variants of some description
but utilizing the same set of GPIOs and commands).

Not to mention, there is now a project site!
