# wdleds

This code repository and the contents of the wiki have been imported from http://code.google.com/p/wdleds/wiki/.
The information below is largely outdated but generally still works.

Instructions are available on the wiki of the project site:
http://code.google.com/p/wdleds/wiki/

However a brief is provided below

To install:
======
Please also ensure you have the following packages installed:
* make 
* gcc 
* lib6c-dev 
* libusb-0.1-4 
* libusb-dev 
* build-essential

Run ./configure
to build the make file.
Then run:
make install
to install the program. (Requires that you have root priveleges)

To use:
======
Before using, please make sure you are a priveleged user as by default
the hardware permissions on Debian (and possibly any distro based off it)
does not allow just any user to control the device.

The easiest way to set the LEDs is to use the "wdsetleds" command
and specify the disk and the value you would like to set. Should you
wish to use "wdleds" please ensure you have the device serial number.
I would recommend against using wdleds directly and instead using it
through "wdsetleds".

If you would like to use the LEDs to display the disk usage as it was 
originally designed for, create a cron job with the "wddiskmeter" 
script and update at 5 or 10 minute intervals (or an interval of your
choosing).

Should you wish to use it as a CPU usage gauge, add a cron job with
the "wdcpumeter" script in a similar manner. 

Should you wish to use it as a RAM usage gauge, add a cron job again
in the same way for the "wdmemmeter" script.

In order to support the newer bar style fuel gauges a "-b" option
was added to the essential scripts. 

Other uses:
===========
You are more than welcome to write your own script and find another way
to use the gauge. Each user will have different needs, but if you think your
script maybe of use to others, feel free to let me know as there always
new uses for the same things. 

Bugs or suggestions:
====================
Please report any bugs or suggestions at the project site.

To uninstall:
=============
Run: make uninstall
Or if you no longer have the make file,
remove the following files:
/usr/local/bin/wdleds
/usr/local/bin/wdcpumeter
/usr/local/bin/wddiskmeter
/usr/local/bin/wdmemmeter
/usr/local/bin/wdsetleds

Don't forget to remove any related cron jobs you may have setup.
